## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

This app uses the Edamam recipe search API to find recipes for the user
and information about the recipes, such as the ingredients and the amount
of calories in each recipe. The app then uses the Kroger API to find the
cost of each ingredient of the recipe at the nearest Kroger. The user starts
at the start screen, where they can go to the bottom right to set their
location using their zip code. By default, the location is set in Athens.
After setting their location, the user can use the search bar at the top
to look up any keywords for recipes they are interested in. The app will
return a randomly selected list of recipes with pictures. The user can
then click on the "View Recipe" button to look at the information of the
recipe. From there, the user can click on any of the ingredients to look
up the ingredient at the nearest Kroger. Clicking on an ingredient will
show the user a list of products at the nearest Kroger that matches the
name of the ingredient, along with their price and a picture of the product.
This app can help any aspiring chefs find the ingredients that they need
to find.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to use Border Panes, which is a very useful tool that helped
me organize my frontend better. I also had to learn how to instantiate
event handlers using a for loop, since I had many buttons that I needed
to create and Java does not allow you to use changing variables in
a lambda expression. However, I feel like the most important thing that
I leanred was how fun it can be to create a coding project on my own.
After this experience, I will be sure to work on more projects as I
come up with any interesting ideas. I will be sure to use the things that
I learned from this project in future projects.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I had to start the project over from scratch, I definitely would
have started earlier. I started a few days before the deadline and as a
result, I was extremely stressed, working multiple hours everyday to
finish my project on time. I also would have chosen something easier,
since my project felt a little difficult to put together. I do not
regret choosing what I chose though, since I still enjoyed the process
of learning how to use APIs and incorporating them together.
